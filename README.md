# Movies-ETL

# Introduction 
ETL is Extract-Transform-Load is a data integration process where you are able to get data from different sources and integrate it into a single file, it is basically
cleaning your data so you can work with it and making it easier for you and the next data analysit. 

# Challenge
We where given 3 databases, a wikipedia database, a kaggle database and a MovieLens ratings database and we had to transform the data to make it compatible with each
so we can join them together to create a full database with all the necessary infromation about different movies, it can be blockbuster movies or indie movies.
The objective of this analysis was to be able to create an ETL pipeline from python to extract data, using panda to clean it and regular expressions (or Regex) to parse the data and transform text into numbers, all of that to create a SQL database.

# Tools
- Sqlalchemy package v.1.4.32
